# The game "Four in a row!"

This is the game for FPGA board Omdazz (Altera Cyclone IV) written on Verilog HDL.<br>
It's purpose is to get 4 equal symbols on indicators by consistently pressing 4 buttons
so each of them stops their 7-segment indicator.
<br>Game is based on Moore final state machine. The goal of creating it was to fully understand how the FSM works.
